DNS
Requirements => Filters Malicious sites + Support DNSSEC + Support DNS over TLS

Using Quad9 + CleanBrowsing

Reason -> https://www.skadligkod.se/general-security/phishing/malicious-site-filters-on-dns-in-2020/

Chose DoT resolvers as systemd-resolved only supports DoT  

Links I used to help configure systemd-resolved and NetworkManager:

**DNSSEC turned off due to multiple issues systemd-resolved seems to be having with DNSSEC, even in `allow-downgrade` mode**  

Faced the "failed-auxiliary" DNSSEC validation error when installing Rust. Also saw considerable slowdown in the `apt update` command.
